# Grommet Primary Page Template

Note: I'm in the process of refactoring this into a Universal template. 

This is the source code for a Grommet based single page app. To run the website execute the following:

  1. Install website NPM modules:

      ```
      $ npm install
      ```

  2. Start the development server:

      ```
      $ gulp dev
      ```

  3. Create the website distribution:

      ```
      $ gulp dist
      ```

  4. Run the back-end server:

      ```
      $ node server/server.js
      ```
